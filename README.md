# expo-repack-starter
A simple expo app that uses repack instead of metro for native apps

These are the steps I used to create this project:
1. `yarn create expo-app host --template`
2. Choose `Blank (TypeScript)`
3. `cd <project_name>`
4. `yarn expo prebuild`
5. Add repack following [these](https://re-pack.netlify.app/docs/getting-started) instructions
